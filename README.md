## Overview

There wasn't much to this project but it was good. The only part of it which was challenging was creating the card in the center.

## My process

First, I started by adding the elements to my HTML file. There weren't a lot of elements so I got to the CSS part quickly. I had to create the card and put it in the middle. I intended to modify the body for this purpose and change its height to have it cover the screen. I then created a container to put the card inside, and after I created the container I worked on the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS cusom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I got a better sense of the sizes in HTML and CSS. I learned how to position the elements better in CSS and learned more about flexbox. I also learned more about media queries.

### Continued development

I'm still not satisfied with the mobile results. I have to improve it.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I don't think W3Schools requires any mentioning. The information on the site is very useful for a quick overview. I always find this site good for the times I forget something in CSS
